Do you want to learn how to program in the C language? In this course, creator, teacher, and technology writer Dan Gookin takes any individual interested in programming from not knowing how to code to being able to develop simple programs. This thorough examination of C touches on every topic relevant to a coder wanting to deep-dive into the language. Dan covers data storage, structures, pointers, file operations, interacting with the operating system, and more. Ongoing challenges throughout the course build upon each other, arriving at the final program, which is a lotto ball drawing simulation. Plus, Dan shows you how to mitigate the vulnerabilities that the C language has to exploitation.
